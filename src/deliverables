Host Behavior:✅
Clicking a Host selects them with a red border and displays their information in the HostInfo component. Styling has been given via classNames (see Host component). ✅

Only one Host can be selected at a time.✅

Only one Host can exist on the screen at a time. If they're in Cold Storage then they're not on the WestworldMap and vice versa.✅

If a host's active attribute is set to false then they are decommissioned and should appear in ColdStorage. The HostInfo radio button should reflect this as well, reading "Active" if active: true and "Decommissioned" if active: false.✅

The Area dropdown should be pre-selected with the area the host is currently in, even if they are in ColdStorage.✅

If a host is Active, selecting a new area from the dropdown should move that host to the corresponding area. If the host is Decommissioned they should not be able to leave ColdStorage, but their area attribute/dropdown should still update.✅

Setting a host's toggle to Decommissioned should immediately remove them from their area and place them in ColdStorage.✅

Limit Hosts: Each Area should only allow the number of hosts given by that area's limit attribute. This includes hosts set to areas in ColdStorage ✅

Activate/Decommission All: ✅
Activate All button onClick:
    activate all hosts
    turn button green and change to read Decommission All
Decommission All button onClick:
    decommission all hosts
    turn button red and read Activate All
